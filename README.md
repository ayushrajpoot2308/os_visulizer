# OS Algorithm Visualizer

A web-based tool for visualizing and interacting with core operating system concepts. This project provides a clear, interactive way to understand algorithms for scheduling, memory management, and synchronization.

### Key Features

* **Scheduling Algorithms:**
    * Round Robin (RR)
    * Priority Scheduling

* **Page Replacement Algorithms:**
    * First-In, First-Out (FIFO)
    * Least Recently Used (LRU)

* **Disk Scheduling:**
    * First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
    * Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)

* **Synchronization:**
    * Peterson's Algorithm for race condition simulation

### Technologies Used

* **Frontend**: React.js, CSS, Recharts
* **Backend**: Flask (Python)
* **Communication**: Axios (API calls)

### How to Run

1.  Clone the repository:
    `git clone https://github.com/ayushrajpoot2308/os_visulizer.git`
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    `cd os_visulizer`
3.  Follow the setup instructions in the project documentation to run both the frontend and backend servers.
